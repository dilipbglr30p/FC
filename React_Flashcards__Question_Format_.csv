How to export the component?,Use `export default Todo` at the bottom of the file.
How to import and use the component in App.jsx?,Use `import Todo from './Todo'` and render it as `<Todo />` in the return block.
What to check if the alert isn't working?,"Ensure the onClick is written in JSX syntax: `onClick={handleClick}`, not HTML-style like `onclick=""handleClick()""`."
What is the final output expected?,"The UI should display heading, image, 3 tasks, and a working alert when the button is clicked."
