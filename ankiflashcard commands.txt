
pip install pandas openpyxl requests
G:
cd AnkiFlashcards

python create_flashcards.py


âœ… Verify That AnkiConnect Is Working
Open a browser and go to:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:8765
You should see something like:

json
Copy
Edit
{"error": "invalid or missing action", "result": null}
This means AnkiConnect is installed and responding.

Now you're ready to send API requests to AnkiConnect using scripts or other tools.

Would you like help testing a basic script or setting up requests from a particular programming language?
